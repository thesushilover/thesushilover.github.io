  <h1 id="very_special"> Sushi some of the best food in this world has been existant for a very long time. Sushi originated in Japan, but as years went by, it spread to other countries and places such as the United States and England. Sushi is a Japanese dish consisting of small balls or rolls of vinegar-flavored cold cooked rice served with a garnish of raw fish, vegetables, or egg. Sushi,  was created by Hanaya Yohei (1799â€“1858) at the end of the Edo period in Edo. Sushi invented by Hanaya was an early form of fast food that was not fermented (therefore prepared quickly) and could be conveniently eaten with a person's hands. The size of the previous sushi was about three times as large as contemporary ones.
